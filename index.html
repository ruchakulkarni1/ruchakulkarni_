                                    to mimic the behavior of the actual data model. My responsibility
                                    was to design a UI, using confd-cli and Yang, same as daemons UI 
                                    on actual data model, and mimic the backend behavior of C code 
                                    using bash, shell or python scripts. It was used for testing new 
                                    upcoming releases before releasing an actual data model. I got an
